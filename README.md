# MazZ's News-Feed
This program uses the 'currents' API which keeps track of current/old News articles from a list of over 43,552 news outlets, all over the world! Including but not limited to: FOX, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, NPR, AP, BuzzFeed, Washington Post, TheHill, NY Times, BBC, SCMP, ADN, CDN, WWLP, TheRegister, SMH, WBBJTV, TMZ, WSVN, WNBC, and MANY MANY MORE!

You can see all the latest articles that have been published, from various News agencies. Or search for something 
specific using keyword(s)/phrases. 

Rather than search through 500 different news outlets, the user can simply use this hub to search through all of them
within a minute.
