# MazZ's News-Feed
This program uses the 'currents' API which keeps track of current/old News articles from a list of hundreds of reliable 
news outlets. Including but not limited to: FOX, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, NPR, AP, BuzzFeed, Washington Post, NY Times, BBC,
SCMP, ADN, CDN, WWLP, TheRegister, SMH, WBBJTV, TMZ, WSVN, WNBC, and MANY MANY MORE!

You can see all the latest articles that have been published, from various News agencies. Or search for something 
specific using keyword(s)/phrases. 

Rather than search through 500 different news outlets, the user can simply use this hub to search through all of them
within a minute.

For API key you can go to: 
https://currentsapi.services/en
- Register account (Free)
- You'll be given a free API key which allows for up to 600 requests per day.
    - If not self-evident >> Replace API_KEY with your own >> Run Program >> VOILA!
    
Note:
If you're running this in a Win32 tty session, the colors may mess with the output since the tty itself does not seem to
read ANSI chars. I am currently working on a fix for this.
